## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements


### Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

**Functional requirements -**

1) The Library Information System will have a login system for people to login and use the system.
2) 3 types of account, one for the librarian, one for the staff members and the third for the students.
3) Each type of account will have different functionalities and privileges.
4) The librarian has administrative privileges and complete control over the entire system.
5) The librarian can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.
6) Members will be allowed to borrow and return books with ease.
7) It will allow members to extend the date of their borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
8) For the staff members, it will allow them to handle and manage day to day transactions of the books.
9) Non-members are allowed only to browse and search books online
10) Only the members of LIS should be allowed to have the previledge of issuing and returning the books.

**Non-Functional Requirements -**

1) The final LIS system would be a web application which uses the latest HTML 5 technology.
2) The software should run only within the institute LAN to ensure security.
3) A strong cryptosystem should be used for the passwords such that only the user should have access to his/her password. Passwords should not be simply stored as plain text inside the database. They should be encrypted and stored which could be decrypted later with ease.
4) To ensure privacy and security of the user, authentication should be used.








### Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

**Scope -**

The scope of the problem is to create a mobile application that will help to address the everyday needs of the community of approximately 5% of the world population (466 million people) that suffers from disabling hearing loss.

**Features -**

1) The mobile application will make use of artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies.
2) It will give immediate alerts about the sounds recognised to the user.
3) The app will provide continual logging that is critical for the user.


**Non-Functional Requirements -**

1) Optimizing the performance of the application to use it in real time.
2) Application should recognise the sound and alert or signal the user without much delay.
3) Latency should be as least as possible to ensure faster response.
4) The application should give accurate and consistent results (of recognising the sounds).
5) Application should be well optimized to ensure smooth functioning and compatibility in android devices.
6) The user data should be kept secured to ensure privacy.
